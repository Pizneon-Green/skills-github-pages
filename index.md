## About The Project

This website serves as a digital companion and showcase for the story "Spoken Jazz & the *tingg* Machine". The narrative follows Bub Pratt, a guitarist and poet on scholarship at Olympic College, and his fellow musicians like bassist Andrew and housemate Marshal Trotland as they navigate life, art, and community in Bremerton, WA â€“ a town heavily influenced by the nearby Navy base.

Key elements explored on the site and in the story include:

*   The struggles and triumphs of young artists finding their voice against a blue-collar backdrop.
*   The importance of community spaces like the **Old Town Tavern** and the **Scott Street House**.
*   The unique atmosphere of the Puget Sound region.
*   The **\*tingg\* Machine**, Bub's vintage Remington typewriter, symbolizing the blend of analog grit and creative rhythm.
*   Themes of jazz, poetry, resilience, friendship, and finding beauty in unexpected places.

The website aims to capture the mood and essence of the story through its design and structure.

## Website Features

*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   **Loading Animation:** Features the iconic "*tingg*" typewriter effect on page load.
*   **Smooth Scrolling & Navigation:** Fixed navigation bar with smooth scrolling to different content sections. Includes a functional mobile hamburger menu.
*   **Scroll Animations:** Subtle fade-in effects for content sections as the user scrolls down the page.
*   **Modular Content Sections:** Dedicated areas for the Story, the World setting, key Players, the Sound/Influences, the Author, and a placeholder Gallery section.
*   **Themed Styling:** Uses a distinct color palette and Google Fonts (Playfair Display, Work Sans, Courier Prime) to evoke the story's atmosphere.

*(Note: Audio player and image galleries were present in earlier versions but have been removed for this iteration).*
