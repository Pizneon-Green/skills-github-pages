    <h2>About Kenny</h2>
    <p>Kenny Johnston is a 56-year-old man living in the heart of Bremerton, Washington. He's a no-nonsense kind of guy who knows his way around a tool belt. Right now, he’s putting in long hours working on a small house in East Bremerton, hanging drywall and turning chaos into craftsmanship.</p>

    <h2>The Project</h2>
    <p>The house he's working on may be small, but it’s got big potential. Kenny is patching, mudding, sanding — the whole nine yards. He takes pride in making things smooth and solid, one sheet of drywall at a time.</p>

    <h2>The Neighbor</h2>
    <p>Now, let’s talk about Ron.</p>
    <p>Ron lives next door. Ron is... well, let’s just say he’s a character. He’s convinced the cops are watching him — drones, unmarked cars, "weird energy in the power lines," you name it. Most days, Ron peeks through his blinds like he's in a spy movie. Kenny mostly minds his own business, but every so often he ends up in a wild conversation that starts with “You didn’t hear it from me, but…”</p>

    <h2>Kenny's Philosophy</h2>
    <p>Kenny doesn’t sweat the small stuff. He likes his coffee like he likes his men: black and hot as hell.</p>
