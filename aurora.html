        <h1>PUBLIC WARNING</h1>
        <h2>Do Not Fall For The Sweetheart Swindler of Washington</h2>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>SUBJECT: AURORA</h3>
            <p>If you have met a charming, sweet-talking Filipino woman named Aurora, this message is for you. She presents herself as a lonely, loving soul looking for a real connection. She will tell you she's 49, single or trapped in a loveless marriage, and that you are the only one who understands her.</p>
            <p><span class="truth-bomb">THIS IS A LIE.</span></p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>THE TRUTH</h3>
            <p>Here are the facts that Aurora conveniently leaves out:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HER REAL AGE:</strong> She is 69 years old.</li>
                <li><strong>HER MARITAL STATUS:</strong> She is, and has been, MARRIED for decades.</li>
                <li><strong>HER FAMILY:</strong> She has FOUR grown children who are well aware of her lifestyle.</li>
                <li><strong>HER TRUE INTENTION:</strong> To gain your trust and then steal your money.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>HER METHOD (THE "ROMANCE SCAM")</h3>
            <p>Aurora is a master manipulator. Her pattern is predictable:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The Love Bomb:</strong> She will shower you with attention and affection, making you feel like the most important person in the world. She'll tell you everything you want to hear.</li>
                <li><strong>The Sob Story:</strong> Once you are attached, the stories will begin. She needs money for a sick relative back in the Philippines. She's short on rent because her "abusive" husband cut her off. A business opportunity fell through. The excuses are endless and always urgent.</li>
                <li><strong>The Squeeze:</strong> She'll ask for small amounts at first ($100, $200) to test the waters. Once you pay, the requests will get bigger and more frequent. She will use emotional blackmail, guilt, and promises of a future together to keep you sending cash.</li>
                <li><strong>The Disappearing Act:</strong> When your money runs out, or when you start asking too many questions, she will disappear. Your calls will be ignored, your texts will go unanswered. She will be on to her next victim.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>PROTECT YOURSELF</h3>
            <p>Do not give this woman your trust, your sympathy, or your money. She is not a victim; she is a predator who preys on the kindness of good men. If you have encountered her, cut off all contact immediately.</p>
            <p class="truth-bomb">You have been warned. Don't let heartbreak and an empty bank account be your wake-up call.</p>
